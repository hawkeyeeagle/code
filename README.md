# code
Code containing hackiowa project


The main file is QweetGUI.py

if you want to edit the code so that you can use it on your own, 
1. Create a twitter app by seaching google for twitter app development
2. Look at your keys 
  *consumer_key
  *consumer_secret
  *access_token_key
  *access_token_secret
3. Take those and edit the code so that they use your parameters
4. The keyword functionality is case sensitive so if your keyword isn't in a quote you think should be in there try making the first letter capitalized 


Thank you for looking at the code and email me if you find any bugs
